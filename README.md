# Advanced Programming 2026 - Group F

Welcome to our project from NOVA SBE! This project was developed as part of a two-day Hackathon focused on building a lightweight environmental data analysis tool using the most recent data available.

We analyze global environmental indicators from Our World in Data (OWID), including:
- Annual change in forest area
- Annual deforestation
- Terrestrial protected areas
- Forest area as share of land area
- Red List Index (biodiversity indicator)
To support geospatial analysis, we also integrate a world countries shapefile from Natural Earth.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to build a modular and reproducible environmental data analysis pipeline.
- Programmatically download and manage multiple environmental datasets
- Structure the project following clean coding principles
- Ensure compliance with PEP8 standards, static typing, and modular design
- Build reusable Python functions/classes for data handling
- Develop a Streamlit application to visualize trends, country comparisons, and geospatial patterns
